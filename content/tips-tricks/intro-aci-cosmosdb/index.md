# Introduction

Easter is always fun with family time and telling stories. Yesterday I was explaining to my youngest about classic games I do like, better known as retro arcade games. They shine due their simplicity, no fancy graphics , just for fun! Who didnâ€™t go to the arcade halls these old days, spending their last pennies.

To show them such a classic we watched the movie PacMan together. After this I got inspired to host my own PacMan game, play together and write this blog to share the tip and tricks how to set this up with Azure Container Instance (ACI) and Azure CosmosDB.

# Running container workloads with ACI

When multiple containers or dependencies are involved you may want to go for AKS, but running a simple `Node.JS` app you may want to look at Azure Container Instance, in short ACI. One of the biggest advantages is that you don't have to manage the container orchestration tool like with AKS. All management of the orchestration platform and underlying instances is done by the Azure team. Next to that you don't pay for the instance capacity, but solely for the resources the container image is consuming. In this use case a very good and easy fit for hosting my **Pac-Man** `Node.JS` app. Let's start with an experiment.

For convinience I have created a repository with all sample material where I saved all my ARM templates. We will use Bicep to deploy the services, but for this I actually had to convert the ARM templates (aka JSON style) to Bicep syntax. 
This can be done using the following command.

```
 az bicep decompile --file template.json
```

This creates a *template.json* which we have to fix a minor thing to support **float** values. This can be fixed replacing 'float(memory)' for 'json(memory)'.
More can be found on this [Github issue 1386](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/issues/1386) on Bicep support for float values.

Adjust the **parameters.json** for your needs and we are ready to deploy our container.

```
az deployment group create --resource-group 'my-playground-sandbox' --template-file template_custom.bicep --parameters '@parameters.json'
```

Now open the FQDN (under Essentials) in a browser and open a session to port 8080. You will see the actual game  Pac-Man loading ...


You have now succesfully deployed the **Pac-Man** `Node.JS` app as ACI workload, but how is persistency arranged of your High Scores? To implement this we are going to deploy CosmosDB, which is  described in the section below. 

You may have seen errors in the container logs or you can try the Command below to look into the MongoDB failures.

```
az container logs --resource-group my-playground-sandbox --name pacman-aci-demo
```

For now, start a new game to enjoy stateless Pac-Man.

# Running MongoDB databases with CosmosDB

As may have noticed, the high scores are not saved yet, since there is no persistency in the backend. In the logging we already learned about a required MongoDB. This is what we can deploy with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB account. We wil use the classic Requst Units (RU) based implementation.

Also here we are going to create a template within the Azure portal and convert this using the `az bicep decompile` command.

This creates a *template.bicep* which seems to work well, but notice the warnings that are displayed.

Adjust the **parameters.json** for your needs and we are ready to deploy our Azure Cosmos DB account. Take notice that `pacman` can already be taken as account name.

```
az deployment group create --resource-group 'my-playground-sandbox' --template-file template_custom.bicep --parameters '@parameters.json'
```

After the acccount is created we also need to create a **Cosmos DB Container**, which is the actual a **Database**. Within that **Database** we create a new **Collection**, which is actually the data collection in *MongoDB* where the documents are stored.

The only thing we have to keep in mind is that **Cosmos DB** is *MongoDB Compatible*, but does have some specific requirements. 
More information can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/introduction). An example is that **Cosmos DB** requires the field a query requests a sort on to be indexed. If this is not the case, *sort* will fail with *error=2*. Read more about these common errors and solutions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/error-codes-solutions). That's why we have created [idx.json](https://github.com/azure-buddy/intro-pacman-aci-cosmosdb/blob/main/README.md).

Below an example of such `idx.json` file

```
[
    {
        "key": {
            "keys": [
                "_id"
            ]
        },
        "options": null
    },
    {
        "key": {
            "keys": [
                "score"
            ]
        },
        "options": null
    }
]
```
Now it's time to create the **Database** and the **Collection** with an defined index as shown above.

Creation of these resouces can be easily created using the Azure portal or using the Command below.

```
az cosmosdb mongodb collection create --account-name pacman --name highscore --database-name highscore --idx '@idx.json' --resource-group my-playground-sandbox
```

After approx 2 minutes the creation is finished and you may want to browse through the collection, which currently contains no **Documents**.


# Updating ACI Container workload with stateful Scoreboard  

After a succcesfull creation write down the following connection information, which can be found within your newly created `Pacman` account settings,under `Connection strings` which we need to setup the app credentials.

|   Setting  | Value |
| -------- | ------- |
| Host  | pacman.mongo.cosmos.azure.com  |
| Port  | 10255 |
| Database | highscore |
| Username | pacman |
| Password | MySecret |

Now that we can this info we can start adjusting our ACI deployment. This can be done by updating our current deployment, but we have some challenges here to not store our *MONGO_AUTH_PWD* in plain text. To ensure we can set an environment variable (using a *.env file*) when doing the deployment. Unfortenately JSON parameter files don't support this, so we are going to convert our `parameters_DB.json` to *Bicepparam* format.

First things first, let's update the `template_custom.bicep` with the following information. Below an example code snippet to start extending your bicep code with some additional parameters. 
Do you notice the difference between *value* and *secureValue* ? Indeed that's why we added *secure()* to ensure string masking.

```
secure()
param environmentVariable0 string
param environmentVariable1 string

environmentVariables: [
  {
    name: 'MONGO_AUTH_PWD'
    secureValue: environmentVariable0
  }
  {
    name: 'MONGO_SERVICE_HOST'
    value: environmentVariable1
  }
]
```

Now complete this `environmentVariables` array with the table below.

| Variable  | Value |
| -------- | ------- |
| MONGO_SERVICE_HOST  | pacman.mongo.cosmos.azure.com  |
| MY_MONGO_PORT  | 10255 |
| MONGO_DATABASE | highscore |
| MONGO_AUTH_USER | pacman |
| MONGO_AUTH_PWD | null |
| MONGO_USE_SSL | true |
| MONGO_VALIDATE_SSL | false |

Don't forget to update your `parameters.json`, but as mentioned above we have to convert it towards *bicepparam* for environment variable support.
First some examples how to include the environment variables and store the changes in a new file called `parameters_DB.json`.

Adding all values be done using this code snippet.
```
"environmentVariable0": {
  "value": null 
},
"environmentVariable1": {
  "value": "pacman.mongo.cosmos.azure.com"
},
```

Let's give the conversion of our `parameters_DB.json` a try and ensure you have the latest version of the Azure CLI installed.

```
az bicep decompile-params --file parameters_DB.json
```

After running above command a new file called `parameters_DB.bicepparam` is created for us. Great now let's update some manual settings.

Set the `Using ''` to your newly created bicep template with DB parameters set.

```
Using 'template_custom_DB.bicep'
```

Now we are going to update our *environmentVariable0* to be read from an *Environment Variable*.

```
param environmentVariable0 = readEnvironmentVariable('MONGO_AUTH_PWD')
```

Save the file and we are ready to deploy using native Bicep code.

```
source .env
cd arm/deployment-template-aci
az deployment group create --resource-group 'my-playground-sandbox' --template-file template_custom_DB.bicep --parameters parameters_DB.bicepparam
```

Great. First you may want to verify the actual resources are created

```
az resource list  --resource-group my-playground-sandbox --output=table
```






# Conclusion

Most scenario's you can easily migrate existing Terraform code with minor adjustments towards OpenTofu. Import to keep in mind is that over time products will differentiate and tool specific features are introduced. We can't look into the future, but for now OpenTofu is a drop-in replacement for Terraform and compatible with 1.5.x and 1.6.x releases.

Hopefully you liked this Tip & tricks introduction into the OpenTofu project article and how to reuse Microsoft Learn Quickstart material to create an AKS Cluster using OpenTofu.
