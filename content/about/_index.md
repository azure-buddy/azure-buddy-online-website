Azure Buddy is a personal initiative, started with :heart: passsion by 'Arnold van Wijnbergen' :sparkles:
{{< /lead >}}

Arnold is a dad, husband, technology geek and energetic person. He is an advisor, architect, chief and subject expert in the field of Cloud Native technology, especially around Observability and Security. Since Last three years Arnold specialized in designing complex Azure Cloud environments and leading Azure platform teams. Most interest is in the area of high-secure hosting of applications and reliable data platforms. Lately he’s more and more involved in Confidential Computing implementations. That’s why he recently started the Sovereign Cloud community within the Netherlands with his partner in-crime Dinant Paardenkooper. Actually you can see us as Azure Buddies. That’s how the name of this personal blog was born. Recently we started our roadshow across various local meetups to share our experiences on the Sovereign cloud topic, otherwise better known as Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty.

During his career Arnold worked at various tech companies and startups like Beyond Blue, Fullstaq and Devoteam as Lead Principal Consultant advising management and customers for innovative solutions. Customers vary from banking, retail to government institutes. You can find him at almost every interesting Meetup near Amsterdam, which covers interesting Azure, DevSecOps, Cloud Native or Continuous Delivery topics. Next to this Arnold is also part-time active in CNCF working groups around Observability or eBPF technology.

Arnold holds many qualifications, like Azure Solutions Architect Expert, Azure CyberSecurity Architect Expert and more. Did you know he started with NT 4.0 migrations as certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) on Windows 2000 and 2003?

You can view all my other certificates at or just visit my [personal LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilovit/) or [Credly Badges](https://www.credly.com/users/arnold-wijnbergen/badges).

Nowadays Arnold is self-employed and is part-time teacher and content writer at the LOI on Azure cloud, cloud, linux and automation study modules. Arnold found his passion in teaching and helping new professionals to succeed with technology.
