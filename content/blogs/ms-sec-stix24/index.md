## What is STIX?

STIX is a structured language for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and provides open source data model. STIX is maintained by Oasis-Open and adopted worldwide by many Security communities and integrated with platforms like Microsoft Unified Security Platform.

## STIX?

Abbreviation stands for Structured Threat Information eXpression. 

## Purpose of STIX?

Purpose of STIX is to enable organizations to share CTI with other organizations in a steady and API ready format, so you as Security Professional get a better understanding of what cyber attacks they are most likely to see and to anticipate potential responses to those cyber attacks faster and more effectively. STIX as a data model can be seen as the foundation for many other capabilities, such as collaborative analysis, threat hunting, sharing threat intelligence like IOC's and automated detection rules for automated responses.
