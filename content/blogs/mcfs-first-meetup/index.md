# First Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty Community Meetup is a fact

Last week we were invited by the `Dutch Azure Meetup` to talk about `Confidential Compute with Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty`. The meetup was organised in the evening, hosted at Xebia Microsoft Services in Hilversum.

During this evening all talks were about Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty related topics. Happy that I could talk and share my experience on this important topic, shaping the future for `next generation secure cloud` implemenations. 

This evening was awesome ! Really liked the open community discussions on several concepts and potential improvements. During that evening I presented with `Dinant Paardenkooper`. Our Azure buddy `Dwaine Ridderhof` presented the second talk with demostrations, more related to `Entra ID`.

Arnold and Dinant explained what Cloud for Sovereignty is, why you want to use this technology in form of practical use cases and how to implement this, combined with lessons learned! We closed the evening providing the ultimate guide protecting your assets in Sovereign Cloud. There was a fantastic big audience, a good atmosphere, great food, lots of good energy, deepdive discussions with a lot of questions answered! Thnx for hosting and everybody that joined. Stay tuned for more updates!
