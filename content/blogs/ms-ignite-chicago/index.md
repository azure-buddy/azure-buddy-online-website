# Microsoft Ignite 2024

Some of us were not able to visit Ignite 2024 in Chicago, but luckily for you I have a curated selection for you, so you don’t miss big things around Cloud Security.

Ignite is a three-day in-person and online event organized by Microsoft and featured partners. Ignite stands for fun, learning, sharing and ultimately getting a unique personal experience by attending breakout sessions, interactive labs, live demos, doing certifications, visiting the Expert hub and networking with community peers.

As always the first day is kicked off by a keynote from Satya Nadella, followed by other great sessions you don’t want to miss. Session can be held by product experts or other industry partners.

Finally my selection of sessions you can easily watch Online. 
To watch the session online you have to register for a free Digital Pass. Go to [Ignite registration](https://register.ignite.microsoft.com/ ), complete your registration and get ready for Ignite 2024 Chicago.
