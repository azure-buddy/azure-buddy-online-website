# Microsoft builds a Open Standards based Observability Platform with Azure Monitor

## Introduction

This blog you we are going to look into the latest feature that make Azure Monitor the most attractive Observability Platform for standardarizing your Observability Platform.

## The Value of MCT Certification

As an MCT, I’m now certified to deliver a training using the official Microsoft training material. This means I can share my cloud security knowledge in a new way and help professionals gain deeper insight into essential tools and concepts. Think of working with Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM, SOAR), Microsoft Defender for XDR and Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (MDTI/TIP) within cloud environments, areas where the right guidance is crucial to optimize the learning experience and to be able to apply it directly in practice.

What also makes the MCT status special is the network of fellow trainers and experts that I come into contact with. The MCT network or MCT lounge not only offers valuable support, but also a community of like-minded professionals who share the same passion for technology and knowledge sharing. Last week I enjoyed the first community meetup in my hometown Amsterdam.

## The ‘Train-the-Trainer’ experience at RBL Training

The ‘Train-the-Trainer’ course at RBL Training proved to be a crucial link in obtaining the MCT certification. RBL Training uses a hands-on approach, where you not only gain theoretical knowledge, but also receive direct feedback on your own training style and approach. In this course I learned how to present technical topics in an accessible way, and I was given practical tools to create interactive and engaging training sessions.

Thanks to the ‘Train-the-Trainer’ training, I now feel more equipped than ever to guide my target group in a coaching and inspiring way. This experience has deepened my vision on training and given me extra confidence to make complex cloud security solutions clear and accessible. Many thanks and big shoutout to Rick Kerssens. More info on the training can be found on the [RBL Training](https://www.rbl-training.com/) website.

## Now what?

The MCT certification opens doors to new possibilities to share my knowledge further. For me it is not only a recognition of my technical expertise, but above all an opportunity to help others grow and feel more confident in using Microsoft Security products. I'm convinced that together, by sharing knowledge and developing skills, we can fully utilize the power of the cloud, applying cloud security and maximize the benefit of using observability tools.

I am very grateful and very much looking forward to taking the next steps with this certification, to giving high quality training, and of course taking my trainees through their learning journey becoming proficient students, gaining technical skills and improving their experience with Microsoft products. That’s why I’ve started an exclusive partnership with OptiSec, which is a provider of Cyber Security training courses to extend their portfolio with Microsoft focussed courses that help Security professionals become more aware of cloud security architecture, engineering and administration topics.

Stay tuned for upcoming training sessions and insights, and feel free to contact me if you want to know more about how my MCT certification can help you on your own learning journey.
