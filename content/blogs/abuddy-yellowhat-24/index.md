# Yellowhat: Premier cybersecurity event dedicated to Microsoft Security Technology

## Introduction

Last Thursday afternoon I joined 150+ Microsoft Security experts at Yellowhat. The event was organized at the Microsoft head office at Schiphol. Online there were also approx 1500 registered attendees watching.

## Entrance and Atmosphere 

After a warm welcome by Rhesa Baar and entering the conference area you already spotted a lot of Yellowhat's. I do mean real Yellowhat’s for construction workers 👷 . Later when entering the conference room, welcomed by Maarten Goet every attendee got a unique Yellowhat as swag, which made everyone part of this unique 🔐 cyber cat photo moment.

## Bootstrapping the Yellowhat's

During the introduction Koos Goossens 🔐 interviewed Dan Michelson who explained why and where the idea of Yellowhat’s was born ✨ . Cool to hear about this fun fact. 

After an inspiring 🚀 keynote talk by Raviv Tamir taking us into the Microsoft roadmap towards a modern SOC, other amazing sessions followed. 

From XDR, the OAuth attack landscape, towards insights into advanced capabilities like automatic attack disruption. In-depth analysis techniques were shown by Thomas Naunheim hitting the 🔥 edges of almost 200 lines of KQL query, which he explained during a demonstration on how to hunt for OAuth tokens. 
The most impressive session was about Windows Hello abuse, where Dirk-jan Mollema showed how passwordless authentication can be fooled by intercepting PRT’s when Windows Hello is used over RDP towards a non-TPM device. 

## Favorite talks you don't want to miss!

Looking back my favorites talks were definitely about hunting OAuth tokens and Windows Hello abuse. If you want to learn more about these sessions, I’ve already gathered some resources.
